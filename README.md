SOLID Principle in software development using Nest JS.

SOLID principle is an acronym that stands for 5 key principles in software development: 

S – Single Responsibility Principle

O – Open Closed Principle 

L – Liskov Substitution Principle

I – Interface Segregation Principle

D – Dependency Inversion Principle

It has become one of the key principles in modern software development to ensure the code is using these SOLID principles. Following are the advantages that offer while using SOLID principles in your software development.

-Helps developers to break down complex problems into smaller manageable pieces.

-Helps developers to reduce the dependencies on code so that in the future if any one area of the code changes, it won’t impact the other area of the code.

-Helps developers to move tightly coupled code or components into a loosely coupled, flexible, and maintainable manner.
